# Practical Ansible Certbot

Trivial module that installs [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to configure your Lets Encrypt certificates and sets up autorenewer using cron that refreshes your certificates every Monday. It is not meant to be configurable to keep it as simple as possible.

Part of [Practical Ansible](https://github.com/spetex/practical-ansible) stack.
